# recursive-strategy-engine
A lightweight agentic framework that uses GPT-4o, recursive micro-agents, and retrieval-augmented context to simulate and evaluate multiple decision paths in parallel.  Built to model strategic thinking, project long-term outcomes, and recommend the most thoughtful path forwardâ€”modular by design, and easy to expand.
